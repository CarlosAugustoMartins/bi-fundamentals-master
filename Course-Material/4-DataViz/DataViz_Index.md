## What is data visualization?
> The **visual representation** and **presentation** of **data** to **facilitate understanding**
- *data* is the fundamental element driving across this process, without data there is no material to feed a visualization > **Which are the types of data?**
- *visual representation* is the actual activity to visualize the data into charts > **How to encode data into visual forms?** 
- *presentation* concerns to the anatomy and design of the visualization > **How to use the colors?**
- we aim to *facilitate understanding* for the viewer in he process of perceive, interpret and comprehend a visualization > **How to design to facilitate this process?** **What type of chart should be used for a determined message?**
