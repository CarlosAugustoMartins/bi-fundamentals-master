# BI-Fundamentals

Repo for MX Course 2020

## Introduction

This repository contains the material for a flash BI course.

The purpose is to make a quick review of the four principal aspects in our Studio:

 - SQL

In future iterations, a self-service course will be launched and a complete DWH can be build using the data hosted in the containers.
